# odin-recipes
This project is to practice my basic HTML knowledge that I have leaned while doing the Odin project. I will be building a basic website that will have a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

After completing this project, I have accomplished: 
Created a website that links to other local webpages 
Created ordered and unordered list
Added images to a webpage
Added links to images
